# Introduction.

This jupyter notebook contains the end of year assessment for Graph Theory,  Summer 2021/2022.
The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate my studies, understanding and learning outcome for <i>Graph Theory</i> and it's role in computer science and mathematics.

# Prerequisites.

Should you wish to alter or closely examine the contents of this journal, you will need to install jupyter notebook to do so. Alternatively, the contents of this journal can be viewed in this github repository.

### Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter installation requires Python 3.3 or greater.

Please use this link provided to get started: [Jupyter via python installation](https://test-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/rtd-theme/install.html#:~:text=Prerequisite%3A%20Jupyter%20installation%20requires%20Python,package%20manager%2C%20or%20using%20Anaconda.)

Once the above guide instructions have been complete, clone this repository and inside you terminal at the designated location, use this command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modelling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

# Concept.

### Graph Theory.

In various industries such as computer science, mathematics, information technology, biosciences and many more, graph theory is the study of graphs, a mathematical structure use to model pair wise relationships between objects from a collection. Graph theory uses vertices (nodes or points) and edges (lines or links) to specify and illustrate these relationships. In this journal, we will look at the important role graph theory plays in computer science by discussing and implementing graph algorithms. 
In this journal, we will look at two an algorithms (<b>Heap Sort and Graph isomorphism</b>), any problems or complexity that accompany them. Whilst taking a deeper look at these problems and their theoretical concepts we aim to achieve a greater understand of them and model them using graphs. Below are brief description of these topics, we will take a more in depth look in their respective journal sections.


# Contents.

### Heap Sort.

Heap sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm. Is is based on a binary heap structure which we can very efficiently model and represent as a graph. The concept of heap sort is to remove elements one by one from a heap and insert those elements into a sorted list. 


### Graph Isomorphism Problem.

During my time of writing, this is still an unsolved problem in computer science. But, a Hungarian computer scientist by the name of László Babai has claimed to have solved this problem. His work is yet to be verified. The Graph Isomorphism problem is to determine if two finite graphs (which represent structures or situations) are identical (isomorphic). This has not yet been shown to be solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm. The graph isomorphism problem arises in many situations and therefore many approaches to solve this have been undertaken.
